# Registration and Attendance System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the issues reported in the registration and attendance system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Records Disappearing After 2pm
**Problem**: Registration records were not showing up after 2pm during events.
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in the database queries and caching issues.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented atomic `findOneAndUpdate` operations in attendance and cancellation APIs
- Added proper cache invalidation with `revalidateTag`
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. QR Codes Not Showing as Scanned
**Problem**: QR codes were scanned but the system didn't reflect the attendance status.
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in the attendance marking API causing data loss.
**Solution**:
- Replaced read-modify-write pattern with atomic updates in `app/api/attendance/route.ts`
- Added `lastUpdated` timestamp tracking
- Improved error handling and validation

### 3. Seats Showing as Full When They Aren't
**Problem**: System showed "seats full" even when max seats hadn't been reached.
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent `maxSeats` calculation due to non-atomic updates.
**Solution**:
- Fixed `maxSeats` update logic in cancellation API
- Added data consistency validation script
- Implemented proper seat counting logic

### 4. Max Seats Changing Automatically
**Problem**: `maxSeats` value was changing unexpectedly.
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in cancellation operations affecting seat counts.
**Solution**:
- Implemented atomic seat count updates using `$inc` operator
- Added validation to prevent inconsistent seat calculations
- Created script to fix existing data inconsistencies

### 5. Queue Numbers Changing Between Registration and Event Day
**Problem**: Queue numbers were different between registration time and event day.
**Root Cause**: Manual queue number reassignment script being run inappropriately.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced queue number generation with retry logic and uniqueness validation
- Added warnings about the `reassignQueueNumbers.ts` script
- Implemented better queue number consistency checks

### 6. Cancelled Registrations Can Still Be Marked as Attended
**Problem**: System allowed marking attendance for cancelled registrations.
**Root Cause**: Missing validation in attendance API.
**Solution**:
- Added validation in `app/api/attendance/route.ts` to prevent marking cancelled registrations
- Enhanced UI to show clear error messages
- Added automatic cleanup of attendance for cancelled registrations

### 7. Date Inconsistencies in Updates
**Problem**: Update dates were inconsistent or incorrect.
**Root Cause**: Missing timestamp tracking for individual registration updates.
**Solution**:
- Added `lastUpdated` field to order schema
- Implemented proper timestamp tracking in all update operations
- Enhanced logging for debugging date issues

## UI Improvements

### Enhanced Queue Number Input
- **Immediate Name Display**: When entering a queue number, the participant's name and status are shown immediately
- **Status Information**: Shows attendance status and cancellation status for quick verification

### Better Pagination Controls
- **Jump to Top/Bottom**: Added buttons to quickly scroll to top or bottom of the list
- **Enhanced Navigation**: First/last page buttons now also scroll to appropriate positions
- **Improved UX**: Added tooltips and better visual feedback

### Duplicate Registration Prevention
- **Phone Number Validation**: Enhanced duplicate detection based on phone numbers
- **Extended Time Window**: Increased duplicate submission detection from 5 to 10 seconds
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when duplicates are detected

## Technical Improvements

### Database Schema Enhancements
```typescript
// Added to order model
lastUpdated: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
```

### Atomic Operations
- Replaced read-modify-write patterns with atomic `findOneAndUpdate`
- Implemented proper MongoDB operators (`$set`, `$inc`)
- Added transaction-like behavior for related updates

### Cache Management
- Comprehensive cache invalidation using `revalidateTag`
- Proper cache headers to prevent stale data
- Strategic cache invalidation points

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages with specific error codes
- Better logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

## Scripts and Utilities

### Data Consistency Fix Script
```bash
# Run the data consistency fix
npx ts-node scripts/fixDataConsistency.ts
```

This script:
- Validates queue number uniqueness
- Fixes boolean type inconsistencies
- Recalculates max seats properly
- Resets attendance for cancelled registrations
- Adds missing `lastUpdated` timestamps

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. **Queue Number Entry**: Enter queue numbers in the attendance interface to see participant names immediately
2. **Pagination**: Use the new scroll buttons to quickly navigate large lists
3. **Data Consistency**: Run the fix script if you notice any data inconsistencies

### For Developers
1. **Cache Invalidation**: Always use `revalidateTag` after data mutations
2. **Atomic Updates**: Use `findOneAndUpdate` instead of read-modify-write patterns
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with specific error codes
4. **Validation**: Add validation for all user inputs and data operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Concurrent Operations**: Test multiple users marking attendance simultaneously
2. **Queue Number Uniqueness**: Verify no duplicate queue numbers can be created
3. **Cancellation Logic**: Test that cancelled registrations cannot be marked as attended
4. **Seat Count Accuracy**: Verify max seats calculations are correct
5. **Cache Consistency**: Test that UI reflects database changes immediately
